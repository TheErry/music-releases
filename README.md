# Music Releases

This project was created to practice using React components and remote mob-programming. The task was to build a page which shows new albums and singles after a given design. The music-release data comes from a downloaded response from the Spotify API.

## The problem

We were 3 people working on this project together. We used mob-programming and did therefor not divide the work amongst us. We started to plan the project in Trello and followed it to finish our tasks. We used map() to display the proper parts of the data like the album-cover-image, the artists name and the album name. We used flexbox to create a responsive design. We found the inspiration to solve our problems by looking at StackOverflow and Github.
